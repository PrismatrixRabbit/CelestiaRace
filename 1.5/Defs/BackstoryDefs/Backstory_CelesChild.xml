		<title>celestia firearms enthusiasts</title>
		<titleShort>firearmkid</titleShort>
		<baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was once thought to have some serious violent tendencies. But as it soon turned out, [PAWN_pronoun] was just extraordinarily curious about the mechanics of these murderous weapons - they had a singular purpose, but how did they achieve that purpose efficiently and quickly through those incredibly delicate mechanics? It completely satisfied [PAWN_possessive] curiosity.</baseDesc>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was born on a habitation station far from the stars, and to [PAWN_pronoun], the stars of [PAWN_possessive] home system looked like nothing more than a dim point of light. [PAWN_pronoun] was taught to aim for the pioneer, but [PAWN_pronoun] never gave up [PAWN_possessive] curiosity about that dim point of light.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was the child of an engineer couple, and while in public-upbringing-centre [PAWN_pronoun] also maintained an almost-friendship with his biological parents, which gave [PAWN_pronoun] early exposure to some of the common sense Celestia's needed for asteroid and space engineering construction, as well as, more importantly, a practical and logical and rational thinking way of thinking.</description>

		<titleShort>firearmkid</titleShort>
		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was once thought to have some serious violent tendencies. But as it soon turned out, [PAWN_pronoun] was just extraordinarily curious about the mechanics of these murderous weapons - they had a singular purpose, but how did they achieve that purpose efficiently and quickly through those incredibly delicate mechanics? It completely satisfied [PAWN_possessive] curiosity.</description>

		<description>Since [PAWN_pronoun] was a child, [PAWN_nameDef] has always been curious about things like rocks and geology, and [PAWN_pronoun] not only went to the museum from time to time, but also, at the invitation of the museum's staff, the young [PAWN_nameDef] began to help out with some of the tasks that [PAWN_pronoun] could handle, such as helping to sort the specimens of the ores. PAWN_pronoun] also learnt a lot of practical knowledge.</description>

		<description>While the other children were still playing around, [PAWN_nameDef] had begun to dive into the kitchen from time to time to watch, and the awkwardness of just watching had naturally turned the spectating into helping with the preparation of ingredients, and then later into helping with the preparation of simple foods. Being a little bit better at something than the other children has helped [PAWN_pronoun] gain a lot of confidence and talkativeness.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] showed a great curiosity about the world, and [PAWN_possessive] questions felt like they could never be answered. Since there were always situations where no adult could answer [PAWN_pronoun], [PAWN_nameDef] began to look through the information to answer [PAWN_objective]. But before long, [PAWN_pronoun] ran into a question that [PAWN_pronoun] couldn't answer ...... What exactly are the ‘Four Laws of Thermodynamics’?</description>

    <!-- EN: celestia black knee-high stocking -->
    <Celes_KneeHighBlack.description>一条黑色的过膝丝袜，适配星铃的身材，兼顾保暖和美观，常用于搭配各种服装。\n\n但事实上如果不是用尘化丝绸或者合成纤维之类的弹力材料制成，这也就是一对稍长而不透明的袜子。</Celes_KneeHighBlack.description>
    <!-- EN: A pair of black knee-high stockings that fit Celestia's figure, balancing warmth and aesthetics, often used to match a variety of outfits. \n\nBut the truth is that if it wasn't made of a stretchy material like Dust-Mech silk or synthetic fibres, it would just be a pair of slightly longer and opaque socks. -->

    <Celes_StockingBlack.label>星铃大腿袜(黑)</Celes_StockingBlack.label>
    <!-- EN: celestia black thigh-high stocking -->
    <Celes_StockingBlack.description>一条黑色的大腿袜，适配星铃的身材，更显腿型而保暖，常用于搭配各种服装。\n\n这种款式的大腿袜虽然广受好评，但在某位服装设计师调整袜口的针织密度之前，这种款式的外侧总是容易意外滑落，而内侧则容易在摩擦中刺激到大腿根部。</Celes_StockingBlack.description>
    <!-- EN: A pair of black thigh-high stocking that fit Celestia's figure, showing off legs more while keeping warm, often used to match a variety of outfits. \n\nThis style of thigh-high stocking is widely praised, but until a certain fashion designer adjusts the knitting density of the cuffs, the outer side of this style is always prone to accidental slippage, while the inner side tends to irritate the base of the thigh in friction. -->

    <Celes_TightBlack.label>星铃连裤袜(黑)</Celes_TightBlack.label>
    <!-- EN: celestia black tight -->
    <Celes_TightBlack.description>一条黑色的连裤袜，适配星铃的身材，完全包裹了下身，常用于搭配各种服装。\n\n相当经典的丝袜款式，据说母星的博物馆甚至曾经展出过来自地球的连裤袜。很多星铃甚至喜欢干脆把这种款式的丝袜直接当作裤子穿，毕竟只要上衣足够宽松就没人看得出来。</Celes_TightBlack.description>
    <!-- EN: A pair of black tight that fit Celestia's figure, completely wrapped around the lower body, often used to match a variety of outfits. \n\nQuite a classic stocking style, it was said that the museums on the home planet had even once exhibited pantyhose from Earth. Many Celestia even like to simply wear this style of stockings as trousers, after all, as long as the blouse is loose enough no one can tell. -->

    <Celes_LightLegArmour.label>星铃轻型腿甲</Celes_LightLegArmour.label>
    <!-- EN: celestia light leg armour -->
    <Celes_LightLegArmour.description>一双及膝的防弹长靴，带有长至大腿的复合纺织材料，足以在轻装的情况下尽可能保护星铃的下肢。\n\n这种轻型腿甲源自星铃IEVA服装的重力靴，一种常被用于在最大限度保证使用者灵活性的同时模拟重力，减震防摔，并提供针对小型太空碎片的护甲保护的设备。而如今，这种结构被星铃拓荒队本土化改良后充当了防弹裤的角色。</Celes_LightLegArmour.description>
    <!-- EN: A pair of knee-high, ballistic boots with thigh-length composite textile material, sufficient to protect Celestia's lower limbs as much as possible in a light suit. \n\nThis lightweight leg armour is derived from Celestia IEVA clothing's Gravity Boots, a device often used to simulate gravity while maximising the user's dexterity, dampen shock and fall, and provide armour protection against small space debris. Nowadays, this structure has been localised and modified by the Celestia Pioneers to act as bulletproof trousers. -->

        They are a race of rabbits from a Shining World genetically engineered laboratory, modified to adapt to low
        gravity and artificial environments in a space colony specialising in post-apocalyptic combat.For a long time
        they have lived in all corners of their home galaxy, which is not limited to habitable planets. \nAfter a
        plague, or rather a devastating catastrophe, that swept through the home system, which they do not wish to
        reveal, they began to disperse to various worlds ...... or were unlucky enough to crash-land on one, pursuing
        and hunting a mysterious parasitic creature.

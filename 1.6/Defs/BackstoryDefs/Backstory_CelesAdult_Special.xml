        <title>celestia detective</title>
        <titleShort>detective</titleShort>
        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] is a professional police detective in the Outer Rim domain who has successfully solved countless dangerous cases occurring in the Outer Rim through his excellent reasoning and deductive skills. [PAWN_pronoun]‘s exquisite fighting skills are the key to [PAWN_pronoun]’s capture of the culprits. \n\nBut a mediocre disappearance case changed [PAWN_possessive]'s life: the daughter of a well-known archaeologist disappeared somewhere in the Outer Rim domain, and in the course of pursuing this case, [PAWN_pronoun] mistakenly invested too much emotion in the girl, allowing [PAWN_pronoun] to unintentionally get involved in a much bigger whirlpool, [PAWN_pronoun] eventually only saw fluorescent blue flowers had bloomed all over that girl's body, the ‘Blue Flood’. \n\nBefore falling too deep, [PAWN_pronoun] struggled to get out, but the fluorescent blue had already entangled [PAWN_possessive], and the fate of the entire Celestia civilisation in the river of destiny.</description>

        <title>celestia psychologist</title>
        <titleShort>psychologist</titleShort>
        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] is a renowned and celebrated psychologist, not only achieving remarkable academic success but also exuding an elegant personal charm in both words and actions. However, the dazzling accomplishments and the divergence in thinking made [PAWN_pronoun] acutely aware of the differences from ordinary people, leading to feelings of loneliness and boredom. Driven by these emotions, [PAWN_pronoun] began to follow [PAWN_possessive] inner self, creating beautiful art as [PAWN_pronoun] true self. But art requires an audience, and with an excessive curiosity, [PAWN_pronoun] sought understanding—finding it in [PAWN_possessive] intriguing patient, an agent.\n\nWhile understanding others, [PAWN_pronoun] was also being understood—[PAWN_pronoun] magnificent art, constructed from corpses, flesh, and actions, was undeniably brilliant.\n\n—[PAWN_pronoun] brutal murders, concealed by identity, knowledge, and intellect, were glaringly evident.</description>

        <titleShort>recorder</titleShort>
        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] once served at the Celestia Institute of Historical Research, approaching history with diligence and dedication, meticulously recording it. However, the outbreak of the "BlueFlood" changed [PAWN_possessive] perspective on documentation—it was not history that recorded civilization, but civilization that recorded history. Thus, [PAWN_pronoun] came to the Rimworld, determined to witness and document everything about Celestia as part of the civilization itself. Only the continuation of civilization holds value, and future generations will judge its worth.\n\n"Vitrification," "indiscriminate cleansing," "The Navigator Programme," "BlueFlood"—[PAWN_nameDef] firmly believes these will not be the final chapters of Celestia's civilization.</description>

        <description>"The entire Celestia civilization is merely a stroke of luck. And luck will eventually run out."\n\nBefore encountering the Archotech, [PAWN_nameDef] was simply a "lucky" archaeologist. At the edge of a planetary terraforming project zone, [PAWN_pronoun] was conducting a protective salvage operation on nearby ancient ruins with [PAWN_possessive] daughter—what we now know to be one of the hubs of the Archotech hidden within the planet. DustMech, psionics, machinery, intelligence, the Archotech—even [PAWN_pronoun] could not comprehend what was awakened and what perished in that brief moment. A wave of fluorescent blue replaced the DustMech that had inadvertently touched the Archotech, and [PAWN_possessive] luck ended that day.</description>

[PAWN_possessive] research is brilliant and groundbreaking.\n\nOne day, [PAWN_pronoun] received an offer from the Celestia Central Committee—a position with unimaginable salary and priority. [PAWN_pronoun] was instructed not to inquire about the details. When [PAWN_pronoun] sought further clarity, [PAWN_pronoun] received a direct reply from the leadership: [PAWN_pronoun] was to design a millennia life-support system for "The Navigator Programme."\n\n&lt;color=#87cefa&gt;"...This will be the most important work of your life."&lt;/color&gt;</description>

The offer included a prepayment vast enough to secure [PAWN_pronoun] and [PAWN_possessive] family’s livelihood for ten lifetimes: "The Navigator Programme."\n\n&lt;color=#87cefa&gt;"...You will chart the course for billions of our kin."&lt;/color&gt;</description>
